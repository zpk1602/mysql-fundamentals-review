Reinforcing SQL fluency by writing practical queries and personal notes based on the SQL portion of AlexTheAnalyst’s 24-hour Data Analyst Bootcamp.

### Note
This repo is a personal practice project based on the SQL portion of AlexTheAnalyst’s 24-hour Data Analyst Bootcamp. All queries and notes are written by me as part of a self-guided review.

###
This project is part of my effort to revisit and sharpen my SQL fundamentals through structured practice. While following the SQL segment of AlexTheAnalyst’s bootcamp, I’m also adding my own notes and examples to reinforce what I already know and ensure I stay sharp.
